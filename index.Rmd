???
A protein that acts as a kind of “brake” to keep the body’s immune responses under control. PD-L1 may be found on some normal cells and in higher-than-normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. When PD-L1 binds to another protein called PD-1 (a protein found on T cells), it keeps T cells from killing the PD-L1-containing cells, including the cancer cells (left panel). 

Anticancer drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors bind to PD-L1 and block its binding to PD-1. This releases the “brakes” on the immune system and leaves T cells free to kill cancer cells (right panel).

FDA approvals of PD-1/PD-L1. 
- As of December 2020, six anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs have been approved with supplemental indications across 19 cancer types and two tissue-agnostic conditions. 
- Shown are the approvals for each cancer indication, for Keytruda (pembrolizumab), Opdivo (nivolumab), Libtayo (cemiplimab), Tecentriq (atezolizumab), Bavencio (avelumab), and Imfinzi (durvalumab). 
- Multiple approvals for a cancer indication within the same year are shown with only one symbol. The open symbols represent approvals without a biomarker (no BM). 
- The full symbols represent approvals that incorporate a biomarker with an associated threshold for each indication (BM), which was measured using either a central laboratory test or complementary diagnostic that was not approved as a CDx for the drug. 
- Symbols with a red outline represent approvals in which a companion diagnostic is indicated for biomarker measurement (BM + CDx). *: approval for MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer. PM, pleural mesothelioma; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; CSCC, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma; TMB-H, tumor mutation burden high; CRC, colorectal cancer; BCG-BC, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bladder cancer; EC, endometrial carcinoma; ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; SCLC, small cell lung cancer; RCC, renal cell carcinoma; MCC, Merkel cell carcinoma; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; PMBCL, primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma; CC, cervical cancer; GC, gastric cancer; MSI-H, microsatellite instability high; dMMR, mismatch repair-deficient; UC, urothelial carcinoma; cHL, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma; HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer. Information on approvals and supplemental approvals was gathered from Drugs@FDA

- In lung cancer, the 4 primary immune checkpoint inhibitors each have a different assay 
- agreement between these assays ranges from poor to high

# Measuring PD-L1 depends on the assay

- tumour cells (TC)
- tumor infiltrating immune cells (IC)
- presence of tumor associated immune cells (ICP) 
- tumour proportion score (TPS) - percentage of TC 
- combined proportion score (CPS)
- .... and others

???
- the percentage of PD-L1-positive tumor cells (TC)
- PD-L1 expressing tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) 
- The percentage of immune cells present (ICP) is reported as the percentage of tumor area occupied by any tumor-associated immune cells.
- Tumor proportion score (TPS) measured the membranous staining of tumors cells and is reported as a percentage of the total viable tumor cells.
- Combined proportion score (CPS) measures the membranous staining of tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages and is reported as a percentage of the total viable tumor cells and multiplied by 100.

???
 As described above, the use of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from ICI treatment remains difficult due to different assays used for each therapeutic, difference in threshold cutoffs across indications, tumor heterogeneity within and across patient populations, the diversity of patients’ treatment history, and the dynamic status of the tumor microenvironment. Perhaps a single-parameter biomarker (e.g., PD-L1) may not be sufficient to accurately stratify patients for ICI therapy...

# PD-L1 take home messages/questions

* different assays, different cutpoints -> modest correlation with outcome?

--

* consider inter-observer reliability (both across and within assays)

--

* importance of classification of PD-L1 status not by apriori... by statistical methods at trial completion? which of the 34 methods? adjust for the multiple comparisons if minimum p-value? 

--

* PD-L1 in isolation -possibly not as strong as seen in other disease types?

--

* need to also measure MMR

* combined with MMR status ->factorial design?

the use of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker to identify those patients who are most likely to benefit from ICI treatment remains difficult due to different assays used for each therapeutic, difference in threshold cutoffs across indications, tumor heterogeneity within and across patient populations, the diversity of patients’ treatment history, and the dynamic status of the tumor microenvironment. Perhaps a single-parameter biomarker (e.g., PD-L1) may not be sufficient to accurately stratify patients for ICI therapy...
I believe we need a collaboration like the BLUEPRINT project in NSCLC; a combination of academia and industry to focus on EC and PD-L1
